# Microsoft-Teams-Automation

Make sure to go through the following to avoid any errors.
______
The tool was scripted in Python 3.9

This works with the current version of Microsoft Teams [1.4.00.11161] , and I might keep updating it further.
_____
• Latest version of Python is advised to use.

• Google Chrome should be installed on your desktop.

• I expect you to have some basic knowledge on how to use python scripts and get meeting links.

• You are supposed to leave your desktop idle until all the lectures are completed. (I'd advice you to use this tool on a alternate device)
_____
• Modules Required :

1] Pyautogui [py -3.9 -m pip install pyautogui] 
 
2] Pynput [py -3.9 -m pip install pynput]
_____
• Joining Multiple Lectures :

Input lectures in the form of lists ["Link","start_time","end_time"] , Example :

Start time and End time are to be feeded in 24Hrs Format.

I would list these 3 already , just fill em with the things required.

Remove the last 2 lists if you want to use it for a single lecture.

You can create more lists (just like these 3) for adding more lectures.
